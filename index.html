<p>
	Please enter the number of recognizable faces that you can see in the picture. For the purposes of this HIT, a face is recognizable if you can see at least half of the front of the person's face. It does not matter how unclear or blurry their face is as long as this condition is met. 
</p>
	
<p>
	A few examples are shown below. Only the faces in a green box are considered recognizable.
</p>	
<img src="pictures\example1.jpg" width="800">
<br />
<img src="pictures\example2.jpg" width="800">
<br />
<img src="pictures\example3.jpg" width="800">
<br />
<p>
	If you feel that there are too many faces to count in a reasonable amount of time, estimating the number is fine as well. If you do choose to estimate the number, please explain your technique in the textbox.
