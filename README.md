Project for CMU class 05-499: Crowd Computing

These pages are designed for conducting a HIT on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The worker must count the number of recognizable faces in each of seven images. For the purposes of this project, a face is considered recognizable if at least half of the face is visible in the image. It does not matter how blurry the face is as long as this condition is met.
